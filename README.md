# Smart Presence

The app works by detecting closed TCP ports of smartphones on your Wi-Fi network. This will work without installing the Homey app, and will allow you to detect guests as well.


#### Installing:

For adding a device, please follow these steps:

1. Check the IP address of the smartphone. This can be done from the admin UI of the Wi-Fi router.
2. Make a static reservation for the IP address.  Also done from the admin UI of the Wi-Fi router.
3. Add the device by entering a name, and the IP address of the smartphone.  Check the 'Is guest' or 'Is kid' - checkboxes for guests or kids.

Ensure you are using PHONE MAC in the settings of your Wifi connection on your phone and not RANDOMIZED MAC.
